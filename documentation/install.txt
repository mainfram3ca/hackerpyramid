Quick start:

1) find the IP address of the machine you will be using as the server. It is the
   machine that will run console.py and server.py to control the game. Edit the
   backend/Audience/json_handler.js, and at the bottom change the IP address of
   the web socket to the server's IP address.

2) cd to Server and run "./server.py -r /absolute/path/to/backend/Audience"

3) plug in the controllers 

4) sudo root in another terminal window

5) cd to Console and run "./console.py"

6) start a browser, (firefox or chrome), and go to http://[ip address]:9000/index.html
   This is the Audience view for the projectors

7) start a browser at the podium. If chrome, go to http://[ip address]:9000/index.html?#s
   and if firefox go to http://[ipaddress]:9000/index.html#s. As long as you put in the #s,
   the browser will self correct if you get it wrong, but at the cost of loosing
   the first message.

8) for chat, put your nick in the "Name" field and leave it there. It never
   needs to be couched again. The text field can be submitted with just the
   Enter key for speedy entry.


That's it.
