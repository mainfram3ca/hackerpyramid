BUGS

- This happened once, but I have not been able to recreate it:
   > ./h.py:1058: UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal
   > if name in os.listdir(VIDEOS):

- continued clicking on "play the game" causes multiple threads. There is no thread limiter.
  Need to detect that the thread is already running and not allow a second run.
  A simple toggle flag may do it

- leaving the game page, the thread continues. it should end.
  A Flag in each game state to end the game early?

- ctrl-c the game also does not end the game thread
